## Data Structures and Algorithms

The system utilizes the following data structures and algorithms:

- Trees: Used to represent the hierarchical structure of departments and staff within the hospital.
- Graphs: Employed for pathfinding and navigation between different areas within the hospital.
- Priority Queues: Utilized in managing the appointment scheduling based on priority.
- Arrays: Used to store and manipulate data efficiently, such as patient records and inventory information.
- Linked Lists: Utilized for efficient storage and manipulation of patient records and staff information.
- Dijkstra Algorithm: Implemented for finding the shortest path between different areas within the hospital.
